    Welcome to Spotted, where we help families locate their lost loved ones. We
    understand that sometimes pets can get a little lost. Our mission is to make
    locating them as stress free as possible. Here on our website we alow users
    to upload information on any pets spotted around their areas as well as
    allowing users to tell us about their loved ones. Help us get as much
    information as possible. Such as last areas seen and most importantly tell
    us if your loved one is approachable or should we keep away as to not scare
    them off! Lastly users can upload a recent image of their lost loved one! We
    hope were able to reunite you with your little ones and bring them home
    safely. So join the spotted community today!
